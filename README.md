# Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) on spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet

The material here aims at giving you an introduction to Stochastic Series Expansion spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The content in this repositories is mainly referencing simple code adopted from [Prof. Anders W. Sandvik](https://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/) and his [website](https://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/programs/ssebasic/ssebasic.html).
