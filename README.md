# Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) on spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet

The material here aims at giving you an introduction to stochastic series expansion of spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The content in this repositories is mainly referencing sample code adopted from [Prof. Anders W. Sandvik](https://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/) .
